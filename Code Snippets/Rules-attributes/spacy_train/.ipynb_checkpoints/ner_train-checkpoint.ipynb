April 01, 2019)\\\\nbusiness relationship between himself and the company whether temporary or permanent, that allows such person, directly or indirectly, access to unpublished price sensitive information or is reasonably expected to allow such access.\\\\n(ii)Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the persons falling within the following categories shall be deemed to be connected persons unless the contrary is established, -\\\\n(a). an immediate relative of connected persons specified in clause (i); or\\\\n(b). a holding company or associate company or subsidiary company; or\\\\n(c). an intermediary as specified in section 12 of the Act or an employee or director thereof; or\\\\n(d). an investment company, trustee company, asset management company or an employee or director thereof; or\\\\n(e). an official of a stock exchange or of clearing house or corporation; or\\\\n(f). a member of board of trustees of a mutual fund or a member of the board of directors of the asset management company of a mutual fund or is an employee thereof; or\\\\n(g). a member of the board of directors or an employee, of a public financial institution as defined in section 2 (72) of the Companies Act, 2013; or\\\\n(h). an official or an employee of a self-regulatory organization recognised or authorized by the Board; or\\\\n(i). a banker of the company; or\\\\n(j). a concern, firm, trust, Hindu undivided family, company or association of persons wherein a director of a company or his immediate relative or banker of the company, has more than ten per cent. of the holding or interest;\\\\nNOTE: It is intended that a connected person is one who has a connection with the company that is expected to put him in possession of unpublished price sensitive information. Immediate relatives and other categories of persons specified above are also presumed to be connected persons but such a presumption is a deeming legal fiction and\\\\nis rebuttable. This definition is also intended to bring into its ambit persons who may not seemingly occupy any position in a company but are in regular touch with the company and its officers and are involved in the know of the company’s operations. It is intended to bring within its ambit those who would have access to or could access unpublished price sensitive information about any company or class of companies by virtue of any connection that would put them in possession of unpublished price sensitive information.\\\\n(e)\"\"generally available information\"\" means information that is accessible to the public on a non-discriminatory basis;\\\\nNOTE: It is intended to define what constitutes generally available information so that it is easier to crystallize and appreciate what unpublished price sensitive information is. Information published on the website of a stock exchange, would ordinarily be considered generally available.\\\\n(f)“immediate relative” means a spouse of a person, and includes parent, sibling, and\\\\nchild of such person or of the spouse, any of whom is either dependent financially on such person, or consults such person in taking decisions relating to trading in securities;\\\\nNOTE: It is intended that the immediate relatives of a “connected person” too become connected persons for purposes of these regulations. Indeed, this is a rebuttable presumption.\\\\n(g)\"\"insider\"\" means any person who is:\\\\ni)a connected person; or\\\\nii)in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information;\\\\nNOTE: Since “generally available information” is defined, it is intended that anyone in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information should be considered an “insider” regardless of how one came in possession of or had access to such information. Various circumstances are provided for such a person to demonstrate that he has not indulged in insider trading. Therefore, this definition is intended to bring within its reach any person who is in receipt of or has access to unpublished price sensitive information. The onus of showing that a certain person was in possession of or had access to unpublished price sensitive information at the time of trading would, therefore, be on the person leveling the charge after which the person who has traded when in possession of or having access to unpublished price sensitive information may demonstrate that he was not in such possession or that he has not traded or or he could not access or that his trading when in possession of such information was squarely covered by the exonerating circumstances.\\\\n(h)\"\"promoter\"\" shall have the meaning assigned to it under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,\\\\n2[2018] or any modification thereof;\\\\n3[(ha) \"\"promoter group\"\" shall have the meaning assigned to it under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 or any modification thereof;]\\\\n4[(5[hb]) “proposed to be listed” shall include securities of an unlisted company:\\\\n(i)if such unlisted company has filed offer documents or other documents, as the case may be, with the Board, stock exchange(s) or registrar of companies in connection with the listing; or\\\\n2Substituted for the number “2009” by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018 (w.e.f.

January 21, 2019)\\\\n(ii)if such unlisted company is getting listed pursuant to any merger or amalgamation and has filed a copy of such scheme of merger or amalgamation under the Companies Act, 2013;]\\\\n(i)\"\"securities\"\" shall have the meaning assigned to it under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956) or any modification thereof except units of a mutual fund;\\\\n(j)\"\"specified\"\" means specified by the Board in writing;\\\\n(k)“takeover regulations” means the Securities and Exchange Board of India\\\\n(Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011 and any amendments thereto;\\\\n(l)\"\"trading\"\" means and includes subscribing, buying, selling, dealing, or agreeing to subscribe, buy, sell, deal in any securities, and \"\"trade\"\" shall be construed accordingly ;\\\\nNOTE: Under the parliamentary mandate, since the Section 12A (e) and Section 15G of the Act employs the term \\'dealing in securities\\', it is intended to widely define the term “trading” to include dealing. Such a construction is intended to curb the activities based on unpublished price sensitive information which are strictly not buying, selling or subscribing, such as pledging etc when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information.\\\\n(m)“trading day” means a day on which the recognized stock exchanges are open for\\\\ntrading;\\\\n(n)\"\"unpublished price sensitive information\"\" means any information, relating to a company or its securities, directly or indirectly, that is not generally available which upon becoming generally available, is likely to materially affect the price of the securities and shall, ordinarily including but not restricted to, information relating to the following: –\\\\n(i)financial results;\\\\n(ii)dividends;\\\\n(iii)change in capital structure;\\\\n(iv)mergers, de-mergers, acquisitions, delistings, disposals and expansion of business and such other transactions;\\\\n(v)changes in key managerial personnel.\\\\n6[***].\\\\n\"',\n",

In any case, it should be remembered that this is only a statutory cool-off period and would not grant immunity from action if the insider were to be in possession of the same unpublished price sensitive information both at the time of formulation of the plan and implementation of the same.\\\\n(ii)not entail trading for the period between the twentieth trading day prior to the last day of any financial period for which results are required to be announced by the issuer of the securities and the second trading day after the disclosure of such financial results;\\\\nNOTE: Since the trading plan is envisaged to be an exception to the general rule prohibiting trading by insiders when in possession of unpublished price sensitive information, it is important that the trading plan does not entail trading for a reasonable period around the declaration of financial results as that would generate unpublished price sensitive information.\\\\n(iii)entail trading for a period of not less than twelve months;\\\\nNOTE: It is intended that it would be undesirable to have frequent announcements of trading plans for short periods of time rendering meaningless the defence of a\\\\nreasonable time gap between the decision to trade and the actual trade. Hence it is felt that a reasonable time would be twelve months.\\\\n(iv)not entail overlap of any period for which another trading plan is already in existence;\\\\nNOTE: It is intended that it would be undesirable to have multiple trading plans operating during the same time period. Since it would be possible for an insider to time the publication of the unpublished price sensitive information to make it generally available instead of timing the trades, it is important not to have the ability to initiate more than one plan covering the same time period.\\\\n(v)set out either the value of trades to be effected or the number of securities to be traded along with the nature of the trade and the intervals at, or dates on which such trades shall be effected; and\\\\nNOTE: It is intended that while regulations should not be too prescriptive and rigid about what a trading plan should entail, they should stipulate certain basic parameters that a trading plan should conform to and within which, the plan may be formulated with full flexibility. The nature of the trades entailed in the trading plan i.e. acquisition or disposal should be set out. The trading plan may set out the value of securities or the number of securities to be invested or divested. Specific dates or specific time intervals may be set out in the plan.\\\\n(vi)not entail trading in securities for market abuse.\\\\nNOTE: Trading on the basis of such a trading plan would not grant absolute immunity from bringing proceedings for market abuse. For instance, in the event of manipulative timing of the release of unpublished price sensitive information to ensure that trading under a trading plan becomes lucrative in circumvention of regulation 4 being detected, it would be open to initiate proceedings for alleged breach of SEBI (Prohibition of\\\\nFraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to the Securities Market) Regulations, 2003.\\\\n\"',\n",
