', ' Now, before moving further, it is to be determined as to whether the   information relating to bagging of orders constitutes \\'price sensitive   information\\' within the meaning of provisions of regulation 2(ha) of the PIT   Regulations. As per regulation 2(ha) of the PIT Regulations \"price sensitive   information\\' means any information which relates directly or indirectly to a   company and which if published is likely to materially affect the price of   securities of company.    Explanation.- The following shall be deemed to be price sensitive information:-  (i) periodical financial results of the company;   (ii) intended declaration of dividend (both interim and final);   (iii) issue of securities or buy-back of securities;   (iv) any major expansion plans or execution of new projects;   (v) amalgamation, mergers and takeovers;   (vi) disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking; and   (vii) significant changes in policies, plans or operations of the company\".         Adjudication Order in the matter of MAN Industries (I) Limited  Page 9 of 19        March 28,2014       I note that the definition of \\'price sensitive information\\' is broad enough to   cover within its ambit any information which if published is likely to materially   affect the price of securities of a company. In this regard, what is relevant to   be seen is that (i) whether the information directly or indirectly related to the   company and (ii) whether the information, if published, is likely to materially   affect the price of securities of a company. If the answers to these two   questions are in affirmative, then the information has to be construed as price   sensitive information irrespective of actual price witnessed post disclosure of   the information.       In the instant matter, from the material available on record, I note that the   company has vide its letters dated April 29, 2009 made corporate   announcement to both NSE and BSE wherein they announced securing a   prestigious order worth Rs 1340 crores from Middle East.  These orders   comprise of  two separate orders - one with Noroo Gustar for a value of 90   million euro  and the other with GRC for a value of 112 million euro. It is also   noted that the company recorded net sales turnover of 1883. 42 crore for the   year ended March 2009 and of Rs 1505.96 crores for the year ended March   2010.  Thus, it is evident that these orders constituted a substantial % of   turnover of the company. The company itself had stated in its letter to   exchanges that  \"MAN Industries (India) Limited, one of the leading Large   Diameter Pipe Manufacturing companies in the country, today announced   securing a prestigious order worth Rs. 1340 crore from middle east during the   current year\". The enormity and the magnitude of the orders is such that it   clearly constitutes price sensitive information and certainly it is impossible for   anyone to treat the information relating to bagging of orders of this magnitude   as one not materially affecting the share price of the company which has   received the orders. As such, in the instant case there cannot be any   hesitation in holding that the information about the bagging of orders was   directly relating to the company and would materially affect the price if   published.         Adjudication Order in the matter of MAN Industries (I) Limited  Page 10 of 19        March 28,2014       In this regard, I further note that the Noticees themselves have considered   bagging of orders of this kind would affect the price. For example, MAN   industries (Noticee No.1), vide its reply dated December 16, 2013, while   explaining /defending the delay in disseminating the information has stated as   under:      \".....it needs to be appreciated that any premature disclosure of information about any  order that is yet to attain finality would not be the interest of the company or even the   investors as the same could boomerang on our clients as they would be held liable for  intentionally misleading the investors by disclosing information about such an order   that is yet to be finalized\".        J C Mansukahni (Noticee No.3) in his reply dated February 11, 2014 has   stated as under:      \".........there were several other distinguishing factors regarding the order of Niroo  Gustar Institute as compared to any other Client, which required the company to be  more cautious and to disclose to the public at large the details of the order, once the   company was confident of its execution. Some of the factors are as under:      i. The order from Niroo Gustar Institute was a significant order to the tune of   90 million Euros.    ii. The order entailed huge raw material cost.   iii. Niroo Gustar Institute is located in Iran and at the relevant time there were   many restrictions imposed on trade with Iran.   iv. Niroo Gustar Institute was a new client and hence sine kind of financial   commitments in tune with the Article 7 of the agreement was required to n  treat the order as executable.     h. From the above factors it is clear that the contract of Niroo Gustar Institute  was an important contract and as a matter of abundant caution required to   be disclosed to the investors at large since the sane a significant  order.........\"      Thus, admittedly, when the company bagged the orders of this magnitude,   there existed a price sensitive information.         Adjudication Order in the matter of MAN Industries (I) Limited  Page 11 of 19        March 28,2014       Further the company itself chose to inform the stock exchanges regarding the   bagging of the said orders and this fact only shows that the company had,   undisputedly, considered information relating to bagging of orders to be   constituting price sensitive information. I also note that the scrip of the   company closed at 4.74 % higher price than the opening price on April 29,   2009 and there was also a quantum jump in the volume traded in the scrip   from 1,20,446 shares to 2,64,668 shares.       Thus, I hold that the information relating to bagging of orders by the company   as stated above was indeed a price sensitive information.      ']\n",
