Per : Justice J.P. Devadhar  
 
  
1. Whether Adjudicating Officer of Securities and Exchange Board of 

India (‘SEBI’ for short) was justified in imposing penalty of ` 40 lacs 

and   ` 13.50 lacs respectively on each of appellants herein on ground 

that appellants have violated section 12A(d) and section 12A(e) of the 

Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992(‘SEBI Act’ for short) 

and regulation 3(i) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India 

(Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992 (‘PIT Regulations for 

short) is the question raised in these two appeals. 

 

2. Since facts in both appeals are common, both these appeals are 

heard together by consent of both parties. 

 

3. SEBI conducted an investigation into affairs relating to buying, 

selling and dealing in shares of Ramsarup Industries Limited (‘RIL’ for 

short) during the period from July 01, 2010 to August 31, 2010.   

 

4. During investigation period it is noticed that RIL had come out 

with two corporate announcements one on July 28, 2010 and another on 

August 13, 2010. On July 28, 2010, RIL had informed National Stock 

Exchange (NSE) that a meeting of Board of Directors of RIL would be 

held on August 13, 2010 inter alia to consider and take on record the 

following:- 

a)  Un-audited Financial results for the 1st quarter ended 

on June 30, 2010. 

b) Raising long term resources by: 



 3

i) Issue of equities/warrants Securities Convertible in 

Equity Shares/ADRs/GDRs/FCCBs. 

ii)  Issue of Equity Shares/ Securities Convertible into 

Equity Shares to eligible qualified Institutional 

buyers.    

 

5. On August 13, 2010 RIL informed NSE that the Board of Directors 

of the Company at its meeting held on August 13, 2010, inter alia has 

approved the following: 

 

a) Issuance of FCCB and/ or other convertible 

instruments to the extent of US $ 250 million/ ` 1150 

crores. 

b) Issuance of 35, 00,000 fully convertible into 1(one) 

equity share of face value of ` 10/- each on a 

preferential basis to the constituents of promoter/ 

promoter group and to non-promoters/strategic 

investors representing not more than 10% of the 

Equity Share Capital of the Company at a price not 

more than 10% of the Equity Share Capital of the 

Company at a price to be determined as per relevant 

provisions of SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2009 as 

amended.  

 

6. It is not in dispute that declaration of financial results for quarter 

ended June 2010 to be made on August 13, 2010 being a price sensitive 

information, RIL by its notice dated August 06, 2010 informed stock 



 4

exchanges that trading window of RIL will remain closed from August 

07, 2010 upto 24 hours after the Board meeting on August 13, 2010.  As 

per clause 3.2.1 read with clause 3.2.3 of Code of Conduct under 

Schedule I of regulation 12(i) of PIT Regulations, every Company is 

required to close its trading window during the time information referred 

to in para 3.2.3 is unpublished.  

 

7. Investigation carried out by SEBI revealed that RIL as well as both 

appellants herein were Companies controlled by Ashish Jhunjhunwala.  

In case of N. R. Mercantiles Pvt. Ltd., (appellant in Appeal No. 138 of 

2013) Ashish Jhunjhunwala and his wife held 68.52% shares of the 

Company and balance 31.48% shares were held by Rav Dravya Pvt. Ltd. 

Ashish Jhunjhunwala and Naveen Gupta were the only two Directors in 

N. R. Mercantiles Pvt. Ltd.  In case of Imtihan Commercial (P) Ltd. 

(appellant in Appeal No. 141 of 2013) 100% shares of the Company 

were held by Mr. Ashish Jhunjhunwala and his wife.  Investigation 

further revealed that Mr. Ashish Jhunjhunwala was also Chairman and 

Managing Director of RIL and Mr. Naveen Gupta was Whole Time 

Director & CEO of RIL.  

 

8. It is not in dispute that N. R. Mercantiles Pvt. Ltd (appellant in 

Appeal No. 138 of 2013) had sold 1650 shares of RIL on May 11, 2010, 

77500 shares on July 30, 2010 and 75000 shares on August 12, 2010, 

out of which sale of 75000 shares of RIL on August 12, 2013 fell within 

the period during which trading window of RIL was closed. Similarly, 

Imtihan Commercial (P) Ltd. (appellant in Appeal No. 141 of 2013) sold 



 5

25000 shares of RIL on August 12, 2013, which was also within the 

period during which trading window of RIL was closed.  Evidence on 

record shows that on behalf of appellants orders for sale of shares of RIL 

were placed by Ashish Jhunjhunwala.  

 

9. According to SEBI, Ashish Jhunjhunwala was privy to financial 

results of RIL for quarter ending on June 30, 2010 and therefore, sale of 

shares of RIL by Ashish Jhunjhunwala on behalf of appellants during 

the period when trading window of RIL was closed constituted violation 

of SEBI Act and PIT Regulation.  On issuance of show cause notice, 

appellant contested it by denying allegations made in show cause notice. 

Rejecting that contention impugned orders have been passed against 

appellants.  Challenging those orders both dated May 31, 2013 these two 

appeals are filed. 

 

10. Findings in the impugned order that Ashish Jhunjhunwala was 

privy to price sensitive information of RIL, prior to his selling 75000 

shares and 25000 shares of RIL on August 12, 2013, has not been 

contested before us by counsel for appellants.  What is argued before us 

by counsel for appellants can be summarized thus:- 

a) Sales effected by appellants were not clandestine 

sales but sales effected through stock exchanges with 

a view to comply with the public shareholding norm 

as provided in clause 40A of the listing agreement.  

b) Sales were effected (when trading window was 

closed and prior thereto) with a view to facilitate 



 6

urgent repayment of debt payable by RIL to various 

lending entities.  Requisite evidence to show that sale 

proceeds on sale of shares of RIL were in fact 

transferred to the bank account of RIL was produced 

before Adjudicating Officer, however, same have not 

been considered in proper perspective.  

c) Relying on decisions of this Tribunal in case of Rajiv 

B. Gandhi & Ors Vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 50 of 2007 

decided on 09.05.2008) and decision in case of Dilip 

S. Pendse Vs. SEBI (Appeal No. 80 of 2009 decided 

on 19.11.2009) it is contended that since sales were 

effected to meet an emergency situation like paying 

of urgent debts of RIL, appellants could not be held 

guilty of violating PIT Regulations. 

d) In any event penalty imposed upon appellants it 

excessive and disproportionate to the alleged offence 

committed by appellants. 

11. We see no merit in above contentions. 

 

12. As rightly contended by counsel for SEBI, facts on record clearly 

show that both appellant Companies were controlled by Ashish 

Jhunjhunwala & Ashish Jhunjhunwala as Chairman and Managing 

Director of  RIL was privy to price sensitive information of RIL when 

he sold RIL shares held by appellants during the period when trading 

window of RIL was closed. 

 



 7

13.  Since counsel for appellant did not press argument relating to the 

question as to whether Ashish Jhunjhunwala was privy to price sensitive 

information of RIL at the time of selling RIL shares by appellants, only 

question that remains to be considered is, whether RIL shares were sold 

by appellants in extra ordinary circumstances and if not, whether penalty 

imposed is excessive? 

 

14.   Argument of appellant that RIL shares have been sold to comply 

with the public shareholding norm as provided in clause 40A of the 

Listing Agreement has been rightly rejected by Adjudicating Officer on 

ground that Listing Agreement nowhere provides for compliance of the 

provisions contained therein even while in possession of unreported 

price sensitive information.  No material is brought on record to show 

that unless shares of RIL were sold during the period when trading 

window was closed, appellants would have been guilty of violating 

Listing Agreement. Therefore, decision of Adjudicating Officer that sale 

of RIL shares by appellants during the period when trading window of 

RIL was closed constituted violation of PIT Regulations cannot be 

faulted. 

 

15.  Similarly, argument of appellants that RIL shares were sold to 

repay debts urgently repayable by RIL to various lending entities do not 

merit acceptance, because, firstly, there is no material on record to 

suggest that debts of RIL had to be discharged during the period when 

trading window of RIL was closed.  Secondly, there is no material on 



 8

record to suggest that RIL has in fact discharged its debt immediately 

after receiving funds from appellants. 

 

16.  Reliance placed by counsel for appellants on two decisions of this 

Tribunal, do not support case of appellants. In case of Rajiv B. Gandhi 

(supra), this Tribunal while upholding penalty imposed for violating 

regulation 3(i) of PIT Regulations as it then stood held that if the motive 

of trade during the period when trading window was closed was to meet 

emergency situation, then, person executing such trade would not be 

guilty of the charge of insider trading. As rightly held by Adjudicating 

Officer, regulation 3(i) of PIT Regulations has been amended in 2002 by 

deleting words “on the basis of” and substituting words “when in 

possession of”. As a result of above amendment trading in securities 

even “when in possession” of any unpublished price sensitive 

information constitutes violation of PIT Regulations. Hence decision of 

this Tribunal in case of Rajiv B. Gandhi (supra) based on provisions of 

PIT Regulations as in force prior to 2002 would not be relevant to fact 

of present case. 

 

17.  Similarly, decision of this Tribunal in case of Dilip S. Pendse 

(supra) is also distinguishable on facts. In that case, appellant therein 

had sold shares when he was not in possession of unpublished price 

sensitive information but sale proceeds of shares sold were received 

after appellant therein became privy to price sensitive information. In 

appeals before us, it is not disputed shares of RIL were sold after Ashish 

Jhunjhunwala acquired knowledge about unpublished price sensitive 



 9

information. Therefore, decision of this Tribunal in case of Dilip S. 

Pendse (supra) is distinguishable on facts. 

 

18.  Alternative argument of appellants that penalty imposed upon them 

is exorbitant is also without any merit. Under Section 15G of SEBI Act 

1992, penalty for insider trading is `25 crore or three times the amount 

of profits made out of insider trading whichever is higher. Finding of 

fact recorded by Adjudicating Officer in these appeals is that potential 

loss avoided by each appellant by insider trading is `13, 17,750/- and               

`  4, 37, 500/-respectively. Hence penalty imposed at three times the 

potential loss avoided being lowest penalty, we see no reason to 

interfere with the penalty imposed upon appellants. 

 

19.  For all aforesaid reasons, we find no merit in these appeals and 

accordingly both appeals are dismissed with no order as to costs.
