State-run green energy financing firm IREDA files for IPO

Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Ltd (IREDA), a state-owned company that finances green energy projects, has filed a draft red herring prospectus for an initial public offering.

The company will issue 139 million fresh shares through the IPO, which was approved by the government’s Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in June this year and is scheduled for the next financial year.

The IPO size is estimated at Rs 850-900 crore ($133-140 million), two people in the know of the matter said, requesting anonymity. This would value IREDA as much as Rs 5,980 crore ($932 million), as per VCCircle estimates.

IREDA will join listed peers such as the state-owned Power Finance Corporation and Rural Electrification Corporation as well as PTC India Financial Services, L&T Financial Holdings and non-banking finance companies like IDFC that provide loans to the renewable energy sector.

India’s renewable energy sector has recorded a number of private equity investments as well as merger and acquisition activities in the recent past. Several private equity investors, such as Actis and Abraaj Group, have set up renewable energy investment platforms in India as the segment has become a preferred asset class because of falling solar tariffs and improving wind technology yields.

VCCircle reported in October that the UK’s development finance institution, CDC Group, was finalising plans to launch a renewable energy platform in India to directly invest in the sector.

Here’s a snapshot of IREDA’s proposed IPO.

Issue
