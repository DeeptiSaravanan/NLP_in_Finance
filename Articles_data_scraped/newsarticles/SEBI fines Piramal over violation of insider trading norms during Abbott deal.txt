SEBI fines Piramal over violation of insider trading norms during Abbott deal

Sebi today imposed Rs 6 lakh fine on five entities including Piramal Enterprises, its chairman Ajay Piramal as well as his wife Swati and daughter Nandini for lapses on insider trading control in connection with the sale of domestic healthcare business to Abbott.

The penalty has also been imposed on N Santhanam.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has disposed of charges against the company's director Harinder Sikka saying he cannot be faulted for the transactions as the company had not closed the trading window which would have checked his trades by way of grant of pre-clearances.

The markets regulator found that entities failed to handle the 'Unpublished Price Sensitive Information' relating to the sale of domestic healthcare formulation business by to Abbott on a 'need to know' basis as Anand Piramal who is neither employee nor Director was privy to the decision at every stage and therefore violated the regulations.

Also, they failed to implement the model code of conduct by not announcing closure of trading window on account of the information pertaining to sale of domestic business to Abbott.

Besides, they did not place the material information with respect to the transaction before the Board of Piramal Enterprises during the process of decision.

Accordingly, it has imposed the fine on the five entities for violating provision related to Prohibition of Insider Trading (PIT) Regulations. The five entities "shall be liable jointly and severally" to pay the penalties.

In a late evening statement, Piramal Enterprises said it would evaluate the options after receiving the Sebi order.

"This issue pertains to a procedural provision with no gains to the promoter family or the management. Once we receive the order from Sebi, we will evaluate our options," the statement said.
