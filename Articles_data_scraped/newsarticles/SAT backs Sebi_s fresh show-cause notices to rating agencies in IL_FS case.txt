The (SAT) has held that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has the power to issue a second set of show-cause notices to rating agencies in the matter. It also said the “proceedings in pursuance to the second show-cause would continue”.

The SAT will further hear the matter after Sebi and India Ratings submit their replies.

The SAT said: “We further direct that the proceedings in pursuance to the second show-cause notice dated January 28, 2020, will continue and Sebi will pass appropriate orders after giving an opportunity of hearing to the appellant (India Ratings) either through physical hearing or through video conferencing.”
