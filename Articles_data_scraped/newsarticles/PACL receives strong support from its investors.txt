PACL receives strong support from its investors

Times Of India : Amidst all the troubles brewing up against PACL, the company is slowly, but gradually, finding light at the end of the tunnel. In spite of directives from SEBI and CBI, the investors of the company are standing by it. They believe that a company that has tried to maintain standard levels of transparency and goodwill, and has stayed genuine in its business dealings, is unfortunately trapped in a legal confusion.

Soon, the company is expected to be back on its feet. One of the investors said, “It’s really perplexing, there must be some sort of a legal confusion. In my personal experience, PACL has been a good company. I have received my payments on time and not for once there was any feeling that I was being smartly duped. The management has even offered me the chance to come and crosscheck the company’s financial sheets, and also any question that may have been bothering the sensitive investors”.

Another one pointed out: “I hope PACL is given more time to make the payments. I have been associated with this company for many years and have complete faith in their working. Whatever SEBI is accusing them of must be some mix-up. The profits I earned through my investment here have been of great help to me. They helped me come out of a financial crisis. Just 90 days are too little.”

A lady investor, who had flown to Delhi to clear her doubts, said: “If they get an extension, I am sure the investors would also get more interest on the invested amount. There are around five crore investors with PACL, according to my knowledge. An extended time limit is a must if the agencies want to safeguard the interest of the investors. If there is a possibility of investors receiving large profits, SEBI shouldn’t have a problem.”

The public sentiment appears to be with PACL. Whether the law feels the same way, only time will tell.
