Mutual fund house UTI AMC files for IPO

UTI Asset Management Co Ltd, the country’s seventh-largest mutual fund house by assets under management (AUM), has filed a draft prospectus to float an initial public offering.

The IPO is entirely a secondary market sale of 38.98 million shares by institutional shareholders led by State Bank of India, according to the prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

The IPO size is estimated at Rs 4,000 crore ($563 million at current exchange rates) but could vary as the share sale nears, said a person familiar with the matter.

SBI has proposed to sell nearly 10.46 million shares, or an 8.25% stake. It owns an 18.24% stake in UTI AMC.

Besides SBI, insurance behemoth Life Insurance Corp (LIC) of India and state-run lender Bank of Baroda have also proposed to sell 10.46 million shares.

State-run lender Punjab National Bank and global asset management firm T. Rowe Price have each offered to sell 3.8 million shares.

The total IPO would result in 30.75% stake dilution on a post-offer basis. It may value UTI AMC at Rs 13,000 crore ($1.83 billion at current rates), VCCircle estimates show.

UTI AMC’s IPO will be the third by an Indian mutual fund company. HDFC AMC, the country’s largest mutual fund by assets, went public in August last year with a Rs 2,800 crore IPO. It sought a market value of Rs 23,161 crore in the IPO that has now soared to Rs 66,775 crore.

Nippon India Mutual Fund (formerly Reliance Nippon Life AMC), the fifth-largest mutual fund company, went public in 2017 with a Rs 1,542-crore share sale. It commands a market capitalisation of Rs 20,677.69 crore, stock-exchange data showed.
