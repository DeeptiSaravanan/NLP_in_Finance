Over 1,000 foreign portfolio investors registered in India in Q1

More than 1,000 new foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have registered with capital markets regulator Sebi in April-July of 2016-17, a sign of their willingness to be part of India's growth story.

This is over and above the nearly 2,900 additional FPIs who got approval from Sebi in 2015-16.

The number of FPIs with Sebi approval increased to 5,322 at the end of July from 4,311 in March-end, translating into an addition of 1,011 such investors, latest data from Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) showed.

FPI investors consider India as a preferred and stable market, given its macro-economic stability, long-term growth prospects and ongoing economic and social reforms, market experts said.

Besides, Sebi has decided to offer direct entry to well-regulated foreign investors for investing in corporate bonds, they added.

They pumped in nearly Rs 30,000 crore in the capital markets (debt and equity) in April-July.

In a big revamp, Sebi in 2014 had released norms that clubbed different categories of foreign investors into a new class called FPIs.

FPIs have been divided into three categories as per their risk profile and KYC (know your customer) requirements while other registration procedures have been made simpler for them. They are granted permanent registration as against the earlier practice of approval granted for one year or five years to overseas entities seeking to invest in Indian markets.

The registration remains permanent unless suspended or cancelled by the board or surrendered by the FPI.

Meanwhile, according to the data, the number of 'deemed FPIs stood at 4,406 in 2015-16. The number totalled 3,467 in April-July of 2016-17.

FPIs (including deemed FPIs) from about 55 different jurisdictions are registered with Sebi.
