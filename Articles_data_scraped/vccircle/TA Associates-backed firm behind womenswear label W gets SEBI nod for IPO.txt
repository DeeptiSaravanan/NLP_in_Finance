TA Associates-backed firm behind womenswear label W gets SEBI nod for IPO

Women’s apparel maker TCNS Clothing Co Ltd, which owns the ‘W’ brand of clothing, has received regulatory approval to float an initial public offering.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued final observations to TCNS Clothing’s IPO proposal on 4 May. This makes it the 16th company to receive regulatory clearance for an IPO in 2018.

TCNS Clothing, which counts US-based private equity investor TA Associates as its backer, had filed its draft proposal on 26 February.

TCNS Clothing’s public issue is entirely a secondary market sale of 15.71 million shares by promoters and Wagner Ltd, an affiliate of TA Associates.

The IPO size is estimated at Rs 800 crore ($122 million), said two persons aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.

TA Associates will sell 6.91 million shares, a little over one-fourth of its holding in the IPO. Its stake may dilute to about 31.6% from 43.72% at the time of filing the draft red herring prospectus.

Onkar Singh Pasricha-led TCNS Clothing had recently won the portfolio company awards (consumer segment) at the recently held News Corp VCCircle India Limited Partners Summit.

TA Associates had, in August 2016, invested $140 million in TCNS, making it the biggest-ever PE deal in the Indian apparel industry. It valued the firm at around Rs 2,130 crore ($317 million then), as per VCCircle estimates.

Kotak Mahindra Capital Co and Citigroup Global Markets India are merchant bankers to the IPO.
