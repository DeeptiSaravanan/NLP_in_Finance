Shalby Hospitals files draft prospectus for IPO

Ahmedabad-based multi-specialty hospital chain Shalby Hospitals, which is operated by Shalby Ltd, on Friday filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for an initial public offering (IPO).

The public issue will comprise fresh sale of shares worth Rs 580 crore besides a partial sale of shares by promoter Vikram I Shah out of his 9.85% stake in Shalby, according to the DRHP.

The total issue size is estimated at Rs 600-620 crore ($97 million) which may result in a stake dilution of 15-18% on post-offer basis, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter, requesting anonymity.

Shah will sell 1 million shares and his shareholding will decline to roughly 7.5% on a post-offer basis. This values the firm around Rs 4,100 crore ($635 million) based on the estimated fundraising.

VCCircle had first reported in September last year that Shalby was eying an IPO and was in the process of hiring merchant bankers.

The firm had earlier explored raising capital via private equity funds, but then decided to list as it would allow it to raise more money.

Shalby will be part of a growing number of healthcare companies that have opted to raise capital via an IPO in recent times.

Bangalore-based hospital chain Narayana Healthcare raised $95 million through a public offering in December 2015 while oncology chain HealthCare Global Enterprises Ltd went public in March 2016 with a $100-million IPO. Aster DM Healthcare also filed a draft proposal in July 2016 for a $300-million listing. It, however, postponed its IPO plans.

Several drugmakers and diagnostic companies have also gone public over the past year.

Here’s a snapshot of Shalby Hospitals’ IPO

Issue:

The public issue will comprise fresh sale of shares worth Rs 580 crore besides an offer for sale of 1 million shares by promoter Vikram Shah.

Shah’s shareholding will decline to roughly 7.5% on a post-offer basis compared with 9.85% stake currently. Total promoter holding will decline to roughly 83-85% post the infusion of fresh shares after the IPO.

Use of proceeds:

Shalby aims to use the proceeds from the IPO to repay certain borrowings availed by the company besides purchasing medical equipment for existing, recently set-up as well as upcoming hospitals. The company also aims to spend the proceeds towards the purchase of interior and infrastructure for upcoming hospitals besides leaving a portion for general corporate purposes.

Shalby’s chief executive officer Ravi Bhandari in an earlier conversation with VCCircle had hinted at enhancing its focus on west and central India, including in cities such as Ranchi, Bhopal and Pune.

Though Shalby has not been active on the acquisition front of late, in 2011 and 2012, it acquired a string of small hospitals, such as Vrundavan Hospital and Research Centre, Usha Hospitals and Krishna Hospital, as per VCCEdge, the data research arm of News Corp VCCircle.

In February 2016, Shalby had signed a joint venture with Dubai-based RAK Hospitals for joint replacement surgeries.
