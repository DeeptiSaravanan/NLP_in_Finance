Publishing house S Chand files documents for IPO; Everstone to partially exit

Education-focused publishing house S Chand & Company Ltd has filed it draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with capital market regulator SEBI to float its initial public offering (IPO).

The proposed IPO comprises fresh issue of shares to raise Rs 300 crore besides an offer for sale by private equity investor Everstone and other shareholders including the promoters.

The move comes soon after it struck its biggest and one of the largest acquisitions in the Indian education related publishing business.

As first reported by VCCircle, it acquired Kolkata-based regional publisher Chhaya Prakashani Pvt. Ltd, which offers a gamut of books catering to up to 12thstandard (K-12), college and engineering, career and children for Rs 220 crore ($32.8 million).

The transaction was made public early this month.

Here’s a snapshot of the IPO

Issue: Fresh issue to raise Rs 300 crore besides offer for sale of 4.8 million shares by Everstone, 0.95 million shares by promoters and 0.25 million shares by other equity holders.

Bankers: JM Financial, Axis Capital and Credit Suisse.

Use of Proceeds

Bulk of the proceeds from the fresh issue of shares will be used to repay loans worth Rs 240 crore. Much of this was used to finance the latest acquisition of Chhaya Prakashani.
